            <h2>about midnight crew</h2>
            <p>
                midnight crew is a group of friends who are just seeking for an escape from <br>
                the boredom they go through everyday. from playing games to watching movies <br>
                and other sorts of stuff they always try to come up with new ways of having fun. <br> <br>
                in the early days of the midnight crew it was raised by a single person who was trying <br>
                to have some fun, but it quickly became a thing where everyone contributed to the group. <br> <br> <br>
